### Rokas Jankunas

Hello, my name is Rokas Jankunas and I'm a a tech enthusiast and a Software Engineer, specialising in Java tech stack. My personal projects have been featured on major tech news websites such as Gizmodo, Lifehacker, Android Authority, and XDA-Developers. In addition to that, I have an Oracle Certified Professional Java certification.

A special thank you:

> Welcome to my GitHub page! While it may seem a bit dormant, rest assured that the projects within hold a special place in my journey as a developer. Over time, my focus has shifted towards work, university commitments, and ongoing personal education, causing me to prioritize other aspects of my professional and academic life.

> Despite the lack of recent updates, this repository is a treasure trove of interesting and useful projects. Some were crafted during my high school years or before my professional journey began, reflecting my self-taught roots. Consequently, you may notice that some projects, especially those born out of my exploration of new technologies, don't quite meet the coding standards I now uphold.

> I want to be transparent about the state of my GitHub, as some projects may be archived, and the code might not be up to the standards I currently strive for. Nevertheless, they still showcase my growth and learning journey.

> Thank you for taking the time to explore my GitHub. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there's a particular project that piques your interest. You can find me using the links below.
